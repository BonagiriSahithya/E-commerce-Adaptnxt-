# ðŸ›’ Simple E-commerce API

This E-commerce  project is a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend, with a minimal HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend to demonstrate key features. It allows users to register and log in as either a customer or an admin using secure JWT authentication. Customers can browse products, search for items, add them to their cart, and place orders. Admins have the ability to manage productsâ€”add, update, and delete products dynamically through the same interface. The project follows RESTful API principles and includes role-based access control to separate admin and customer functionalities. Itâ€™s a clean and simple implementation suitable for learning, showcasing, or extending into a larger e-commerce application.
